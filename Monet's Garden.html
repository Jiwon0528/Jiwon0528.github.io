    <h1>Monet's Garden</h1> 
  </div>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><em>Claude Monet</em> was obsessed with nature and flowers. He made his garden and it accompanied him during times of emotional toll, artistic frustration, and financial hardship during his career. When his family moved to <em>Giverny</em>, he rented a large house with a garden. With the help of his family, he changed the appearance of the garden from a farming plot to a flowering garden. Around the house, he sowed seeds for his favorite annuals: poppies, sunflowers and nastrutiums. Unlike structured and rather linear French gardens, Monet's one was acquiring more English style.</p>
