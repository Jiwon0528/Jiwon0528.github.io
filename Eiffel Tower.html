  <p>The <em>Eiffel Tower</em> is a wrought-iron structure in Paris that is among the most famous landmarks in the world. It is also a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. It was designed and built (1887-1889) by <em>Gustave Eiffel</em> and named in his honor.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>When the French government was organizing the International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the <em>French Revolution</em>, a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted, and the <em>Centennial Committee</em> accepted that of the noted bridge engineer <em>Gustave Eiffel</em>. Eiffel's concept of a 984-foot tower built almost entirely of open-lattice wrought iron aroused amazement, skepticism, and no little opposition on aesthetic grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.</p>
