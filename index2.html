  <h1>Species</h1>
  <h2>Emperor Penguin</h2>
  <p>The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 39 in
     in length and weighing from 49 to 99 lb. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened 
     into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods,
     such as squid. While hunting, the species can remain underwater around 20 minutes, diving to a depth of 1,755 ft. It has several adaptations
     to facilitate this,including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the 
     ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions. The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic 
     winter, emperor penguins trek 31â€“75 mi over the ice to breeding colonies which can contain up to several thousand individuals.
     The female lays a single egg, which is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents
     subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild,
     although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age.</p>
