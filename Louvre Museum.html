  <h1>Louvre Museum</h1> </div>
  <p>The <em>Louvre Museum</em> is a national art museum in Paris. It is located on the Right Bank of the <em>Seine</em>. It is the home to some of the most famous works of Western art, including the <em>Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory</em>. The museum is housed in the <em>Louvre Palace</em>.</p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p><em>The Louvre</em> was originally built as a fortress in the late 12th 14th century. By the 14th century it had become more of a residence for the French royal family. By the 17th century, <em>Louis XIII</em> and <em>Louis XIV</em> expanded it significantly, but it was abandoned as a royal residence when <em>Louis XIV</em> moved to <em>Versailles</em>. Following the <em>French Revolution</em>, it opened as a public museum in 1793. The 19th century saw further expansion, and in the late 20th century, the iconic glass pyramid entrance was added. Today, <em>the Louvre</em> is one of the world's most famous museums, housing masterpieces like the <em>Mona Lisa</em> and the <em>Venus de Milo</em>, and has expanded its influence globally with projects like the <em>Louvre Abu Dhabi</em>. </p>
